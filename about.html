            <p>Opened in 1934, Strand’s Ski Shop is Worcester County’s finest full service ski shop offering a huge selection of ski and snowboard equipment and accessories, ski apparel, helmets, boots, bindings, travel racks, dryers and more. Not in the market for new equipment? Strand’s has a wide selection of used skis, boots, snowboards and other equipment. We also offer a variety of services including expert custom boot fitting, tune-ups, binding mounting and a “try before you buy” demo program.</p>
            <p>Family-owned and operated, Strand’s Ski Shop was founded by 3-time National Ski Jumping Champion, U.S. Skiing Hall of Fame member and founder of the Eastern Professional Ski Jump Association, Strand Mikkelsen. Mr. Mikkelson operated his shop until his sons, twins Leif and Roy and Paul joined the business. Leif’s expertise is custom boot fitting and much of his time in the shop is dedicated to creating perfectly fit boots for our customers. Roy concentrates on maintaining and tuning-up customer skis relying on skills honed through many years of experience and state-of-the-art computerized system to perfectly prepare our customer’s skis or board.</p>
